##Overview
[Travis-CI][o1] is a hosted continuous integration service for the open source community. It is integrated with GitHub and offers first class support 
for a lot of languages.

I find it really useful and, as you'll see if you check my repositories, we use travis for a lot of our (and my) projects. However, sometimes it is
not possible or even convinient to have to open a web browser and check travis web to check the logs. What if you're working on a server
without desktop environment?

TravisTracker provides you a command line interface to check your repositories and builds in an interactive way.
